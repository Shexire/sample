<h3> designing a clear and accessible wayfinding system </h3>

<nav>
      <p> Recently healthcare institutions have expanded their campuses by adding several buildings to the main facility. It is important that the overall architecture of the new and old facilities match in order to avoid chaotic systems of connected corridors and gates that impede wayfinding, especially for new users. In addition, the old compact facilities commonly provide very limited access to outside views and daylight for the occupants, thus creating even more obstacles for the occupants to orient themselves in the buildings.</p>
      <p> I worked on a project that dealt with the above-mentioned challenges. Our team conducted research to learn different approaches to improve the wayfinding experience among occupants. One of the main challenges in this project was facilitating wayfinding for patients who are not native English speakers. To address this issue, we realized that wayfinding had to happen on multiple levels so that users did not need to rely on only one method of getting around, such as signage or maps.</p>
