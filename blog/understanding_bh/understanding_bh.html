            <div class="blog-text-wrapper">
                  <p>The exact definition of behavioral health can depend on the context of each specific country but the generally accepted definition in the U.S. is broad and primarily refers to anything related to mental health, all types of addiction disorder, substance use and it covers a wide age range from children to seniors. Furthermore, it is very common to have co-occurring diagnosis of mental health with disabilities such as developmental or with disorders such as substance disorder. These crossovers create obstacles in the process of delivering the appropriate care for each patient and emphasize on the importance of why we must come up with better solutions that comprehensively address all mental health related needs. </p>

            <div class="blog-text-wrapper">
                  <p> Behavioral health has been one of the most overlooked areas in healthcare for many years, but fortunately, in recent years we made significant progress in designing new facilities that better address mental health needs. Statistically, more than 46 million adults in the US (approximately 1 in 5) experience some type of mental illness or disorder of which, more than 11 million (approximately 1 in 25 adults) suffer from a serious mental illness in a given year. The eye-opening fact is that one of our family members, friends, or colleagues may be suffering from one or more type of mental illness right now. </p>
                  <p> As we move forward, the need for having more facilities with higher care quality becomes a necessity. According to NAMI, Serious mental illnesses cost U.S. more than $193 billion each year but only 41% of adults (approximately 11.2 million) receive mental health services. </p>

                  <h3> understanding behavioral health design </h3>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-text-wrapper">
                  <p> Well-being and built-environment are symbiotic in healthcare facilities and this connection becomes stronger when it comes to designing psychiatric centers. In such settings, the smallest, the most subtle design elements and details can make significant differences. One of the biggest design objectives is to keep patients safe from harming themselves like committing suicide or causing serious injuries to themselves and to each other. Also, medical staff safety becomes very important as more than half of nurses in behavioral health facilities experience physical assault while working. Therefore, details can play a crucial role in patient and medical staff safety and it has great importance to be fully aware of these issues as we focus on improving the quality of care. </p>
                  <p> To better understand and categorize security needs to have proper design approach for each area, zones of risk are classified under three categories. Low-risk zones include corridors and common areas, in which patients are accompanied and observed, along with staff-only areas such as nurse station core rooms, clean utilities, and staff offices. Medium-risk zones apply to areas in which patients are rarely alone or have some supervision such as dayroom and dining room. High-risk zones apply to areas in which patients are mostly alone and are often not supervised. This includes patient rooms, toilet rooms, and patient showers. We experience the highest risk of self-injury and suicide in zones of high risk. </p>
                  <p> Patient suicides are great concerns in designing such facilities. An important medical planning objective is to always provide clear visual access for medical staff to all rooms and patients to reduce these types of incidents. Also, patients should not be able to use the whole or a piece of furniture as a weapon to hurt medical staff, other patients, or cause self-harm. For this reason, it is to have every object, detail, and design feature elements ligature-resistant and considered carefully especially in high-risk zones to prevent such incidents. This includes all window treatments, lighting fixtures, ceiling grids and tiles, door hardware, showerheads, curtains, toilets, face washes, etc. For furniture design, solid, built-in, and properly mounted furnishings are preferred wherever possible. Otherwise, it is important to carefully consider the shape and the weight of the furniture. Also, Where furniture flexibility needs to be provided, we should be completely aware of the possibility of patients using furniture to hide contraband. </p>
