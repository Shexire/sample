<h3> optimizing behavioral health facilities </h3>
<nav>
      <p> Since we are required to have a nearly constant observation and monitoring in behavioral health, patients feel very controlled and these environments almost always do not feel like a therapeutic place. It is critical to understand we need to maintain patient’s dignity as we make sure our design accommodates both patients and medical staff safety. For the mentioned reasons, it is crucial to move toward designing de-institutionalized facilities by creating warm and welcoming facilities where patients can take steps toward healing and coping their illness. Along with that, we should create a home-like atmosphere which is similar to patients’ home when they leave the facility. This can minimize the sense transition for patients when they first come to receive care as well as when they return home. We need to change the way care is delivered by emphasizing on the patient’s dignity. We should let the patients take over their path of the healing journey, help them get there instead of controlling them and remove the stigma associated with mental health. </p>
      <p> Furthermore, moving toward more passive surveillance strategies rather than active is another step in creating a de-institutionalized atmosphere and environment. Having access to outdoor spaces is another important aspect that helps the healing process. In the case of having limited access to outdoor areas, creating access to natural daylight and view becomes crucial. Nature can be used as a positive distraction factor that can benefit all patients. It can be calming and provides a therapeutic setting. Abstract images of nature have shown to have positive distraction impact on patients where there were few opportunities to have windows and views to the outside. </p>
