<h3> visual access in medical planning  </h3>
<nav>
      <p> Providing clear visual access for medical staff to every corridor and room is a critical objective in behavioral health medical planning along with providing quick and easy physical access. Medical staff in nurse station core; which includes but not limited to the nurse station, charting room, and medication room, should have legit vision access to all patient room doors, common areas such as dayroom, and corridors. Having narrow lite and borrowed light doors also helps in extending the visual access beyond doors and walls. </p>

<h3> understanding ligature risk </h3>
<nav>
      <p> In the design process for patients suffering from mental illnesses, it is crucial to eliminate all points of ligature that a patient can use a rope, cord, or bed sheet to loop or tie to a fixture. A great portion of furniture and elements that can normally be used in healthcare settings, cannot be used in psychiatric settings as they may pose a risk of ligature. We must use alternate products that can serve the same function but cannot create risk for either patients nor medical staff. In some extreme cases, some patients may try to make loops using a rope or cord to commit suicide by self-strangulation. It is important to understand that patients have a lot of time to think and finding new ways of self-harm and by thorough elimination of ligature risk we can save patientsâ€™ lives. </p>
      <p> There are two general treatments for the anti-ligature refurbishment of rooms. The primary treatment is providing fixed ligature-resistance. This term refers to items that are required to bear a considerable amount of load such as door handle, shower head, and toilets. The overall shape of these fixtures is similar to sphere or and egg so that a rope or cord cannot be tied or looped around the fixture to create ligature. </p>
      <p> The secondary treatment option is utilizing load-release ligature resistance. This solution is relatively new but simple and very effective in elimination or reduction of ligature risk. This mechanism is based on using magnetic brackets in the furniture. These brackets can hold a range of different elements using a short-range yet powerful magnetic attraction. These magnets are just as powerful to hold the designated element and any abnormal force created by patients will overcome the power of the magnets and immediately releases the load. This function will not cause any mechanical constraints and after each incident, the removed element can reseat back by simply holding it near its magnetic bracket. This solution prevents patients from using the different elements for purposes other than what they are assigned to. </p>
      <p> The other concern in ligature risk area is weaponry deterrent. Patients can use the whole furniture or a piece of it by breaking or removing as a weapon to hurt themselves or others. It is important to be aware of how different items such as a wardrobe rail can be removed by force to be used as a weapon. While medical staff in such environments are trained to confront patients in these situations, it is crucial to minimize this risk by using alternate product design or details. </p>

<h3> materials and texture choose </h3>
<nav>
      <p> While choosing materials for a behavioral health facility is not much different from other healthcare facilities, there are a few other considerations we need to pay extra attention to. In general, there are two major questions we need to answer. First is what is the nature of the patient population? For example, is it for patients with substance abuse, addiction, or any other mental illness? The second question is, what is the age range for patients and are patients children, adults, or seniors? For instance, for the geriatric population, we need to choose materials with sensible contrast between walls and floors to make sure patients with vision problems can properly distinguish different surfaces and this will not create a falling hazard. On the other hand, finishes with high contrast between background and grain colors can create the illusion of a physical grain on the surface and it can get problematic for some patients. They may try to remove grains off the surface by hand for hours. </p>
